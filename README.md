## Bugs

The game had a bug where certain combinations ended up with the wrong result.

Since the code was confusing to follow I ended up rewriting it.

Before

After

Using the "or" operator made it possible to have two winning "player" conditions for each hand the computer chooses.

This makes it a lot easier to read and fixed the bug.

## Testing

The game was tested during development through the live previewer in Chrome browser.
And then one again when deployed

## Deployment

The game is deployed in Github pages.

- I went to settings that's on the repository bar
