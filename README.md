## Bugs

The game had a bug where certain combinations ended up with the wrong result.

Since the code was confusing to follow I ended up rewriting it.

Before

After

![342177013-2fc1bb3d-90b3-44bf-9e21-85960352da36](https://github.com/MarcelaMor/CosmicClashGame/assets/159925451/64d350f1-5a1a-4749-9a94-7b302fdfaa18)


Using the "or" operator made it possible to have two winning "player" conditions for each hand the computer chooses.

This makes it a lot easier to read and fixed the bug.

## Testing

The game was tested during development through the live previewer in Chrome browser.
And then one again when deployed

## Deployment

The game is deployed in Github pages.

- I went to settings that's on the repository bar
